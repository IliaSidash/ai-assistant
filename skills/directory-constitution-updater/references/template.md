# Constitution Update Guidelines

> **Note**: This template is deprecated for feature/page directories. Use this only for architectural principles and infrastructure directories.

## For Application Code Directories

Instead of adding to the constitution, create a `README.md` within the directory:

```markdown
# [Directory Name]

## Purpose

Brief description of what this directory contains and why.

## Key Components

- `File1.vue`: Description
- `File2.ts`: Description

## Usage

How to use or integrate with this code.
```

## For Architectural/Infrastructure Changes

When updating `.agent/memory/constitution.md`, add to the appropriate section:

- **Architecture Overview**: New layers, patterns, or import rules
- **Tech Stack**: Framework or library changes
- **Code Conventions**: New standards or practices
- **Infrastructure Directories**: Tooling directories like `.agent/`, `scripts/`, etc.
