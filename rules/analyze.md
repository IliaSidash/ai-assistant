Before starting work on any implementation task (coding, refactoring, debugging), you MUST first read and analyze the project memory files:

- [.agent/memory/constitution.md](cci:7://file:///Users/i.sidash/web/fft/tradernet/.agent/memory/constitution.md:0:0-0:0) - architectural principles and project structure
- [.agent/memory/migration-guide.md](cci:7://file:///Users/i.sidash/web/fft/tradernet/.agent/memory/migration-guide.md:0:0-0:0) - migration patterns and guidelines

Use this information to ensure your implementation aligns with project standards and consider relevant technical debt when making decisions.

Exception: You may skip this for simple tasks like answering questions, viewing files, or one-off explanations without code changes.
